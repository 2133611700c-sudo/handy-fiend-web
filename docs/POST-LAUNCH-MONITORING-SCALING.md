## PART 1: DAILY MONITORING (30 minutes/day)

### 1.1 Morning Routine (8:00am)

**Every morning, check these metrics:**

   ☐ CTR: Click-through rate >5%? (Good engagement)
   ☐ Avg CPC: Paying too much per click? (<$0.80 = good)
   ☐ Call clicks: How many phone calls? (>1 = working)

   ACTION:
   - If keyword had 0 conversions after 10 clicks → PAUSE
   - If keyword had 3+ conversions → INCREASE BID
   - If CTR <3% → Test new ad copy

2. FORMSPREE EMAIL:

```

### 1.2 Afternoon Routine (5:00pm)

```

---

## PART 2: WEEKLY MONITORING (1-2 hours/week)

### 2.1 Monday Morning: Weekly Review

**Every Monday, analyze full week of data:**

```
GOOGLE ADS ANALYSIS:
1. Download last 7 days of metrics
2. Calculate average:
   - CPC (cost per click): Target <$0.80
   - CTR (click-through rate): Target >5%
   - Conversions: Target >3% of clicks
3. List top 5 keywords by performance
4. List bottom 5 keywords (prepare to pause)

GA4 ANALYSIS:
1. Go to: analytics.google.com
2. View last 7 days of:
   - Sessions: Total website visits
   - Users: Unique visitors
   - Conversion rate: % who submitted form
   - Lead value: Avg value per form submission
3. Compare to previous week (is it growing?)

META PIXEL ANALYSIS:
1. Go to: Meta Ads Manager → Events Manager
2. View last 7 days:
   - Lead events: How many submitted form?
   - Lead quality: How many confirmed bookings?
   - Lead cost: ÷ leads by ad spend

LEAD TRACKING:
1. Update Google Sheet:
   - Leads by source (Ads, LSA, GBP, Organic, SMS)
   - Leads by service type
   - Conversion rate (leads → bookings)
   - Revenue (bookings × avg job value)
   - CAC (cost per acquisition = ad spend ÷ bookings)

Example Monday Report:
  Week of Feb 24-Mar 2:
  ├─ Leads: 15 (target: 10-20 ✓)
  ├─ Bookings: 3 (target: 2-4 ✓)
  ├─ Revenue: $600 (target: $400-800 ✓)
  ├─ Ad spend: $140
  ├─ CAC: $47 (under budget ✓)
  └─ ROI: 4.3x ✓ PROFITABLE
```

### 2.2 Wednesday: Optimization

**Mid-week optimization actions:**

```
KEYWORD OPTIMIZATION:
1. Pause keywords with:
   - 0 conversions after 10+ clicks
   - CPC >$2 with low conversion
   - Irrelevant search terms

2. Increase bids on keywords with:
   - 3+ conversions this week
   - CPC <$0.50 (room to bid higher)
   - High conversion rate >20%

EXAMPLE:
  PAUSE (low performer):
  - "handyman course" (not a customer)
  - "diy tv mounting" (DIY person, not hiring)
  - Keyword: "painter commercial" (outside service area)

  INCREASE BID (top performer):
  - "tv mounting los angeles" (5 conversions, $0.40 CPC)
  - "furniture assembly near me" (3 conversions, $0.35 CPC)
  - Call: from $0.75 → $1.00 (high value)

AD COPY TEST:
If CTR <3%, test new ad copy:
  CURRENT (Low CTR):
    Headline: "Professional Handyman in LA"
    Headline: "Same-Day Quotes"
    Description: "Fast service, upfront pricing"

  NEW TEST:
    Headline: "Handyman in LA - $150 Flat Rate"
    Headline: "TV Mounting & Furniture Assembly"
    Description: "Free quote, 2-hour response"

LANDING PAGE:
- Is CTR low? Maybe traffic is bouncing
- Check: Is calculator visible? Is form confusing?
- Consider: Add FAQ section, more proof chips
```

### 3.2 Second Week: Strategy Update

**Plan for next month based on data:**

```
IF ROI IS GOOD (>2x):
  ✓ SCALE UP:
    - Increase daily budget ($20 → $30-50)
    - Increase bids on top keywords (+10-20%)
    - Expand to TIER 2 keywords
    - Add new service categories

IF ROI IS MEDIOCRE (1-2x):
  ⚠ OPTIMIZE:
    - Pause bottom 20% keywords
    - Improve landing page (more proof, better CTA)
    - Test new ad copy
    - Add negative keywords (filter out cheap seekers)
    - Focus on best-performing service

IF ROI IS BAD (<1x):
  ✗ PIVOT:
    - Cut ad spend in half (preserve capital)
    - Focus on free sources (GBP, organic)
    - Improve offer (pricing, messaging)
    - Hire consultant (if stuck >1 month)
    - OR consider pausing ads temporarily

PRICING ADJUSTMENT:
  If booking rate >50% and backlog 2+ weeks:
    → Raise prices 10-15%
  If booking rate <20%:
    → Improve offer, not lower price

SERVICE ADJUSTMENT:
  If 70%+ of bookings are TV mounting:
    → Increase TV mounting ad spend
    → Consider specializing
  If no demand for plumbing/electrical:
    → Pause those services
    → Focus on high-demand services
```

### 3.3 Third Week: Expansion

**If profitable, expand the business:**

```
EXPANSION OPTION 1: Increase Budget
  Current: $20/day ($600/month)

## PART 4: SCALING TO $100K/MONTH

### 4.1 Unit Economics (The Foundation)

**Before scaling, ensure unit economics are PROFITABLE:**

```
EXAMPLE PROFITABLE UNIT ECONOMICS:
├─ Customer acquisition cost (CAC): $50
├─ Average job value: $200
├─ Repeat/referral rate: 30%
├─ Lifetime value (LTV): $260 ($200 + $60 referrals)
└─ LTV:CAC ratio: 5.2x (excellent)

WITH THESE ECONOMICS:
  Spend $1,000 on ads
  Get 20 customers
  3 repeat/refer = 6 more customers
  Total 26 customers × $200 = $5,200 revenue
  ROI: 5.2x

SCALING MATH:
  Month 1: 20 leads, 10 bookings = $2,000
  Month 2: 40 leads, 20 bookings = $4,000
  Month 3: 80 leads, 40 bookings = $8,000
  Month 4: 160 leads, 80 bookings = $16,000
  Month 5: 320 leads, 160 bookings = $32,000
  Month 6: 640 leads, 320 bookings = $64,000
  Month 7: 1,000+ leads, 500+ bookings = $100,000+

REQUIREMENT: Keep CAC consistent as you scale
(Don't overpay for scale)
```

├─ Expand to 2 geographic areas
├─ Launch new service types

If CAC < LTV → SCALE AGGRESSIVELY
If CAC = LTV → OPTIMIZE FIRST
If CAC > LTV → FIX THE MODEL
```

### Avoid Common Mistakes
```
❌ Scaling too fast (CAC rises, ROI drops)
❌ Ignoring data (gut feel vs. numbers)
❌ Not responding to leads (lose deals)
❌ Raising prices too early (kill growth)
❌ Hiring too many people (burn cash)
❌ Not tracking metrics (flying blind)
```

### Stay Focused
```
Month 1-3: Perfect the core business (one channel)
Month 3-6: Expand to 2-3 channels
Month 6-12: Scale everything aggressively
Year 2+: Diversify, systems, team
```
