## 1. GBP (GOOGLE BUSINESS PROFILE) - COMPLETELY FREE

### What is GBP?
- Google's free local business listing
- Shows in Google Maps, Google Search, Google Ads
- **Does NOT require paid ads** (organic)
- 40% of local searches lead to calls/visits

### Setup Checklist (1 Hour)

**Step 1: Go to Google Business**
```
https://business.google.com/
Sign in with Google account (create if needed)
Click "Manage your business"
```

**Step 2: Verify Ownership (Free)
- Google sends postcard with code to your address
- OR verify by phone if eligible
- OR verify domain if you own handyandfriend.com (instant)

**Step 3: Complete Profile (Critical for LSA/Ads)**

Fill every field:

| Field | What to Enter | Why |
|-------|---------------|-----|
| **Business Name** | Handy & Friend | Must match site |
| **Category** | Handyman, Home Repair | Drives relevant searches |
| **Service Area** | LA County ZIPs (90001-90099) | LSA requirement |
| **Address** | Your business address or service area | If no office, can be ZIP-only |
| **Phone** | 213-361-1700 | Must match site |
| **Website** | https://handyandfriend.com | Exactly as on site |
| **Hours** | 8am-8pm Daily (or real hours) | Affects lead quality |
| **Description** | 250 chars max, keyword-rich: "Professional handyman in Los Angeles. TV mounting, furniture assembly, painting, repairs. Fast quotes, upfront pricing. Licensed, insured." | Affects search ranking |
| **Service Highlights** | Add 5: "TV Mounting", "Furniture Assembly", "Same-Day Service", "Upfront Pricing", "Licensed" | Appears in search results |

**Step 4: Add Photos (5-10 minimum)**
```
Best photos (no budget needed):
1. Before/After: TV mounted on wall (or furniture assembled)
2. Before/After: Art hanging on wall
3. Business photo (you in work clothes)
4. Team/office (if applicable)
5. Work in progress (shows professionalism)
6. Customer testimonial (selfie with happy customer, permission required)

- "This week's highlights: [project photos]"
- "Holiday special: [service] for $[price]"
- "New review from [customer name]: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

```

**Step 6: Q&A Section (Reply to Questions)**

- "Do you come to [ZIP code]?"
- "What's the cost of TV mounting?"
- "Are you licensed?"

**Reply to all questions immediately** (shows responsiveness).

**Step 7: Review Management (CRITICAL)**
```
After each job:
1. Email customer: "Rate us on Google! [link]"
2. SMS customer: "Google review? [link] Thanks!"
3. WhatsApp: "Please leave a Google review 5⭐"

Goal: Get 10+ reviews in first month (shows social proof).

Current reviews: 0 (need to build this immediately)
```

### Expected Results (Organic, Zero Cost)
- **Week 1:** Profile live, showing in local search
- **Week 2:** First few calls from Google Maps
- **Month 1:** 10-20 calls/inquiries if profile complete

### What is LSA?
- Google's "request a quote" button for local services
- Shows above organic results
- **You only pay when someone requests a quote** (~$5-15 per lead)
- Better conversion than regular Ads (pre-qualified)

**TL;DR:**
- [ ] CSLB decision (Option A or B)
- [ ] GBP 100% complete (above)

- [ ] Business license

### Setup (After above done)
```

2. Click "Create account"
3. Verify insurance certificate
4. Set service areas (LA county ZIPs)
5. Set quote price (if hourly: "$150 service call")
6. Wait for approval (5-10 days)
7. Customers click "Request Quote" → they call you
8. You get charged $5-15 per verified lead
```

### Cost Breakdown
- **Service call leads:** $5-10 per lead (if customer books)
- **Paint/flooring leads:** $10-20 per lead

## 3. GOOGLE SEARCH ADS - FREE $500 CREDIT

### What is Google Ads?
- Pay-per-click ads above organic search
- **Your $500 credit = ~7,000 clicks** (if CPC $0.07)
- Appears for "handyman Los Angeles" + similar

### But WAIT: Only Start After...
- [ ] GA4 fully tracking (you can see "conversions")
- [ ] Form submission tracking verified
- [ ] Call tracking set up (optional but recommended)
- [ ] SMS leads tracked

**Why?** If you can't see which keywords bring conversions, you'll waste budget.

### Steps to Get $500 Credit

**1. Verify GA4 Conversions:**
```
In Google Analytics 4:
- Create conversion event: "form_submit"
- Create conversion event: "phone_call"
- Create conversion event: "sms_lead"
- Test them manually
```

**2. Setup Google Ads (Link to GA4):**
```
Go to https://ads.google.com
Sign in with same Google account
Create campaign: "Local Services"
Link to GA4 (tools → data streams)
```

**3. Claim $500 Credit:**
```
Go to Ads → Billing → Promotions
Enter code when prompted (Google sends to email)
Usually: GGLOCALC5 or similar
Click "Apply"
```

**4. Create Campaign:**
```
Campaign type: Search
Location: Los Angeles (or ZIPs: 90001-90099)
Languages: English, Spanish
Budget: $50/day (~$1,500/month from $500 credit)
CPC bid: Start $0.50-1.00 (handyman searches cheap in LA)
```

**5. Keywords to Bid On:**
```
High Intent (higher CPC, better ROI):
- "handyman near me" [exact]
- "tv mounting los angeles" [exact]
- "furniture assembly near me" [exact]
- "painter los angeles" [exact]
- "handyman west hollywood" [geo]
- "furniture assembly 90210" [geo + zip]

Broad (lower CPC, volume play):
- "handyman" (broad)
- "home repair" (broad)
- "painter near me" (broad)

Negative keywords (IMPORTANT):
- -"diy" (don't want DIY searches)
- -"how to" (don't want tutorials)
- -"cheap" (attracts bargain hunters)
- -"looking for volunteer" (not paying customers)
```

**6. Ad Copy Template:**
```
Headline 1: "Fast Handyman in Los Angeles"
Headline 2: "Same-Day Quotes • Upfront Pricing"
Headline 3: "TV Mounting • Furniture • Repairs"

Description: "Professional handyman services. Free estimates. Call 213-361-1700 now."

Landing page: https://handyandfriend.com/#calcBox
(Goes to calculator for instant engagement)
```

### Expected Results
- **$500 budget = 7,000-10,000 clicks** (depending on keywords)
- **Click-to-call:** 5-10% (500-1,000 calls)
- **Call-to-book:** 20-30% (100-300 jobs)
- **Average job:** $150-500
- **Revenue:** $15,000-150,000 (from $500 budget) ✅
