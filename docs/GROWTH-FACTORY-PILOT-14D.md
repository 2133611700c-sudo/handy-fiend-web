Date: 2026-02-26
Owner: Sergey
Goal: Increase qualified leads from free channels without ad spend.

## North Star
- Primary KPI: Qualified leads per week (phone + form + WhatsApp)
- Secondary KPI: Cost per lead from paid channels (keep at $0 during pilot)
- Guardrail KPI: Response time under 10 minutes during business hours

## What Is Already Implemented In This Sprint

  - Services/specializations filled (8 core services)
  - Bio rewritten for conversion CTA
  - Website link updated with UTM tracking
  - Profanity filter enabled for comments
- Website lead attribution upgrade:
  - Frontend now sends attribution with lead form submit
  - Captures utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, utm_content, utm_term
  - Captures click IDs: fbclid, gclid, msclkid, ttclid, gbraid, wbraid
  - Backend now stores attribution and sends source summary to Telegram/email
  - Telegram photo context now includes click IDs summary
- Service photos upgraded from low-res to higher quality local assets

## Free Channel Engine

### 1) Local SEO + GBP (Google Business Profile)
- Task: Daily GBP update post with before/after image and one CTA
- KPI: Calls from GBP, direction requests, website clicks
- Risk: Inconsistent posting cadence
- Template: "Before/after in [area]. Same-week handyman availability. Call (213) 361-1700"

### 2) Facebook Organic
- Task: 1 post/day (offer, before/after, tip, social proof)
- KPI: DM count + WhatsApp clicks + call clicks
- Risk: Overly promotional posts reduce reach
- Template: "Today in Los Angeles: [job result]. Need similar help? Message now."

### 3) Instagram Reels
- Task: 1 short reel/day (7-20 sec) from real work process
- KPI: Views, profile visits, DMs
- Risk: Weak hook in first 2 seconds
- Hook templates:
  - "How to fix this in 15 minutes"
  - "Before/After: [service] in LA"
  - "3 mistakes homeowners make with [service]"

### 4) Referral Loop
- Task: Send review + referral follow-up 24h after completed job
- KPI: New reviews/week + referred leads/week
- Risk: Requesting review before confirming customer satisfaction
- Template: "If everything looks good, could you leave a quick review? If a neighbor needs help, I can prioritize them this week."

### 5) Community Outreach
- Task: Join 10 local neighborhood groups, answer problems first, promote second
- KPI: Comment replies + profile visits + inbound messages
- Risk: Group bans for direct promo
- Rule: 80% helpful replies, 20% service mentions

## Daily Execution Grid (14 days)
- Day 1-2: Baseline metrics, GBP services/checklist, post templates, UTM links
- Day 3-4: 2 before/after reels, 2 educational posts, 1 offer post
- Day 5-6: Collect first 3 testimonials/reviews and repurpose to posts
- Day 7: Weekly review, keep top 3 formats, drop bottom 3
- Day 8-10: Neighborhood outreach + FAQ content burst + reels cadence
- Day 11-12: Referral push and review follow-up wave
- Day 13: Landing page CTA/copy micro-iteration from top FAQ objections
- Day 14: KPI audit and scale plan for next 30 days

## No-Budget Content Mix
- 40% before/after proof
- 30% educational practical tips
- 20% social proof/reviews
- 10% direct offer CTA

## Messaging Rules (to increase conversion)
- Reply speed: under 10 min during 8am-8pm
- Message length: short, direct, actionable
- Always ask for:
  - Address
  - 2-6 photos
  - Preferred time window
- Always provide:
  - Next step
  - ETA for callback or arrival

## Immediate Backlog
- Connect Instagram account in Facebook linked profiles
- Add pinned Facebook post with one CTA and one offer
- Publish 3 reels from existing job media
- Add weekly review workflow (Sun evening):
  - Top post by reach
  - Top post by DMs

  - >= 20% increase in weekly qualified leads
  - >= 5 new public reviews
  - >= 7 reels published in 14 days
  - Median response time under 10 minutes
- Fail if two or more are missed; then pivot messaging angle and content hook set.
