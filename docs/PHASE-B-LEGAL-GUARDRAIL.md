# 🏛️ PHASE B: LEGAL GUARDRAIL & COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST
**Status:** CRITICAL BEFORE LAUNCHING PAID ADS / LSA / LEADS

---

## 1. CALIFORNIA BUSINESS REGULATIONS (CSLB)

### Problem
As of **January 1, 2025**, California law restricts unlicensed home service contractors:
- **Maximum contract value: $1,000** (labor + materials combined)
- **No permit work**
- **No structural modifications**
- Violation = fines up to $5,000 + criminal liability

### Handy & Friend Current Position: ❓ NEEDS CLARIFICATION

**DECISION REQUIRED (choose ONE):**

#### OPTION A: STAY UNDER $1,000 (No License Needed)
**Services you can offer:**
- TV Mounting (bracket provided by customer)
- Furniture Assembly (IKEA-style, simple items only)
- Art & Mirrors Hanging (up to 5 pieces)
- Weatherproofing caulk (non-structural)
- Touchups (paint refresh, same color)

**Services you CANNOT offer without CSLB:**
- ❌ Full wall painting (>200 sq ft is "structural modification")
- ❌ Flooring (installation = construction)
- ❌ Plumbing (even cosmetic = regulated)
- ❌ Electrical (any fixture swap = regulated)

**Impact on current site:**
- Current offerings mention "Painting, Flooring, Plumbing, Electrical" → **TOO BROAD**
- Must either:
  1. **Pivot to < $1,000 services only** (TV, Furniture, Art)
  2. **Get CSLB license** (see Option B)

#### OPTION B: OBTAIN CSLB LICENSE (Contractor License)
**Requirement:** Pass exam + get bonded + insurance
**Cost:** ~$2,500-5,000 (exam, application, bond)
**Timeline:** 4-8 weeks
**Benefit:** Can offer ANY home repair service

**Action if choosing this path:**
1. Check `cslb.ca.gov` for requirement checklist
2. Get General Liability Insurance ($500-1,500/year)
3. Apply for license via CSLB portal
4. Pass exam

---

## 2. OFFER & COPYWRITING FIX (Required regardless of option)

### Current Copy Issues (from index.html)
```html
"Professional Handyman Available Today"
"TV Mounting • Furniture Assembly • Painting & More"
"Painting, Flooring, Plumbing, Electrical"
```

**Problem:** "& More" + listing regulated services implies you can do everything → legal risk

### Fixed Copy (CSLB-Compliant)

#### If Option A (No License - Under $1k):
```html
<!-- HERO -->
"Premium Handyman Services — Los Angeles"
"TV Mounting • Furniture Assembly • Art Hanging"
"Labor Only, Upfront Pricing. Small Home Repairs up to $1,000"

<!-- SERVICE GRID - ONLY show: TV, Furniture, Art -->
<!-- HIDE: Painting, Flooring, Plumbing, Electrical -->

<!-- FOOTER -->
"Handy & Friend is not licensed. Services include small home repairs under $1,000 (labor only).
For structural work, permits, or full renovations, consult a licensed contractor."
```

#### If Option B (Licensed):
```html
<!-- HERO -->
"Licensed Handyman — Los Angeles (CSLB #123456)"
"TV Mounting • Furniture Assembly • Painting • Flooring • Plumbing • Electrical"
"Labor Only. Full License, Insurance, Bonded."

<!-- Display all services with confidence -->

<!-- FOOTER -->
"Handy & Friend is a licensed CSLB contractor. General Liability Insurance: $2M. Bonded."
```
