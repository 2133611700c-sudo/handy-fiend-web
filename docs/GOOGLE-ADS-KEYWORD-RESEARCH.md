## PART 1: UNDERSTAND KEYWORD STRATEGY

### 1.1 Keyword Matching Types

Google Ads uses 4 match types:

```
1. EXACT MATCH [exact search term]
   - Shows ONLY when user types exact phrase
   - Most expensive (high intent)
   - Example: [handyman near me]
   - Best for: Converting keywords you're confident about

2. PHRASE MATCH "phrase search term"
   - Shows when user includes phrase in order
   - Medium cost
   - Example: "handyman near me" matches "need a handyman near me asap"
   - Best for: Balanced approach (cost + reach)

3. BROAD MATCH broad keyword match
   - Shows for related searches (Google decides)
   - Cheapest (but includes junk traffic)
   - Example: handyman → "plumbing service", "furniture repair"
   - Best for: New keywords (test & expand)

4. MODIFIED BROAD +keyword +modifier
   - Broad + word must be included
   - Good middle ground
   - Example: +handyman +los +angeles
   - Best for: Controlling scope without exact match cost
```

### 1.2 Keyword Structure for Handyman

```
HIGH INTENT (People ready to buy):
  - Exact: [handyman near me]
  - Exact: [tv mounting los angeles]
  - Exact: [furniture assembly 90210]
  - Phrase: "handyman services near me"

MEDIUM INTENT (People researching):
  - Phrase: "how much does painting cost"
  - Phrase: "handyman rates los angeles"
  - Broad: painting service

LOW INTENT (Educational, not buying):
  - Broad: how to mount tv (DIY, not hiring)
  - Broad: diy furniture assembly
  - Broad: handyman course
  → AVOID THESE
```

### 1.3 Negative Keywords (CRITICAL)

Negative keywords = words to EXCLUDE from your ads.

```
WHY?
- Saves money (don't show for irrelevant searches)
- Improves conversion rate (only serious buyers)

EXAMPLES OF NEGATIVES TO ADD:
-diy (person wants to do it themselves)
-how to (searching for tutorial, not hiring)
-course (searching for education, not hiring)
-job (job seeker, not customer)
-cheap (bargain hunters, not quality)
-free (people wanting free work)
-volunteer (not a real customer)
-licensed (they're looking for licensed only; you're cosmetic)
-major repairs (you only do $1K max)
```
