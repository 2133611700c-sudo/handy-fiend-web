```

### How to Take Photos (Phone Camera)

```
SETUP (Before taking photo):

1. LIGHTING:
   - Use daylight (8am-4pm is best)
   - Avoid harsh shadows (11am-1pm can be harsh)
   - Position subject between you and light source
   - NOT backlit (light behind subject)

2. COMPOSITION:
   - Use rule of thirds (imagine 3x3 grid)
   - Put main subject on one of the lines
   - Include context (25% background)
   - Avoid clutter outside frame

3. CAMERA SETTINGS (iPhone/Android):
   - Use back camera (not selfie)
   - Lock focus (tap on subject, hold)
   - Use "Grid" to align (Settings → Camera)
   - Turn OFF digital zoom (use feet to move closer)

4. ANGLE:
   - Shoot from standing height (normal viewing)
   - NOT from below (makes you look small)
   - NOT from above (unflattering)
   - Slightly angled (12-15°) looks better than straight

5. AFTER TAKING:
   - Take 5-10 photos, pick the best
   - Slight crop if needed (remove excess)
   - Minimal editing (don't overprocess)
   - NO fake backgrounds or filters

## PART 5: WHAT NOT TO DO (Common Mistakes)

```
❌ MISTAKE 1: STOCK PHOTOS
   Problem: Google can detect stock photos (they're generic)
   Result: Photos might be hidden or marked as "not verified"
   Solution: Use ONLY real photos of YOUR work

❌ MISTAKE 2: FAKE BEFORE/AFTER
   Problem: Editing software makes "before" look worse than real
   Result: Customers feel deceived when they see real "before"
   Solution: Honest photos = better trust

❌ MISTAKE 3: PHOTOS WITH FACES (Privacy)
   Problem: Customers might object (no permission)
   Result: Google might remove for privacy concerns
   Solution: Blur customer faces, or ask permission first

❌ MISTAKE 4: BLURRY OR BAD LIGHTING
   Problem: Makes your work look unprofessional
   Result: Lower click-through rate
   Solution: Take 5+ shots, keep the best

❌ MISTAKE 5: TOO MANY SELFIES
   Problem: Customers want to see YOUR WORK, not your face
   Result: Photos don't convert
   Solution: Max 1-2 selfies per 10 photos

❌ MISTAKE 6: IRRELEVANT PHOTOS
   Problem: Photos of random stuff not related to services
   Result: Confuses customers, lowers trust
   Solution: Every photo = service you offer or business credibility

❌ MISTAKE 7: NO CAPTIONS
   Problem: Google doesn't understand photo context
   Result: Poor SEO, less searchable
   Solution: Add captions with service name + location

❌ MISTAKE 8: PHOTOS TOO ZOOMED IN
   Problem: Can't see context or scale
   Result: Doesn't show professionalism
   Solution: Include 25-30% background context
```
