# 📄 LSA DOCUMENTS PREPARATION

**CRITICAL:** Local Services Ads require verification documents. Without proper documentation, your LSA application will be REJECTED and you'll waste weeks.

**Status:** Need to collect & prepare (not yet started)
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks to gather documents
**Cost:** $0 (use existing documents)
**Approval Time:** 5-10 business days after submission

---

## WHAT IS LSA & WHY IT MATTERS

### Local Services Ads (LSA) Overview

```
Google Local Services Ads = "Lead generation ads for local services"
- Appears ABOVE Google Ads in search results
- Customer sees: "Request Quote" button
- You ONLY PAY when qualified lead comes in (~$5-15 per lead)
- NOT cost-per-click (you pay for actual leads, not just clicks)
```

### LSA vs Google Ads

| Feature | LSA | Google Ads |
|---------|-----|-----------|
| **Cost Model** | Pay per lead (qualified) | Pay per click |
| **Position** | Above Ads #1 | Regular ads #2-4 |
| **Conversion Rate** | Higher (pre-qualified) | Lower (raw clicks) |
| **Approval** | Strict (need verification) | Moderate |
| **Cost/Lead** | $5-15 | $0.50-2 (may not convert) |
| **Best For** | High-intent customers | Awareness & traffic |

### Expected ROI Example

```
GOOGLE ADS:
$100 budget
→ 100 clicks @ $1/click
→ 10 form submissions (10% conversion)
→ 2-3 actual jobs (20-30% conversion)
→ Revenue: $300-600

LOCAL SERVICES ADS:
$100 budget
→ 10-15 qualified leads @ $7-10/lead
→ 4-6 actual jobs (40-60% conversion)
→ Revenue: $600-1,200

Result: LSA has 2-3x ROI vs Google Ads
```
